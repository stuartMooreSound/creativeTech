Some basic code to help get a quick start using midi in browser to connect custom and not-custom controllers for any old reason you can imagine :)

To get started:
  Plug a usb midi device into your machine,
  Have the html and js code in the same folder and open up the html in a browser. I use chrome generally. If you
    use something more exotic then theres the chance you'll need to adapt something. This is just a basic sketch! :)
  The HTML calls midiInit() in the js code to get things started. Here I've put the call in the onload in the html <body>      tag.
  Open the browser console and you should see the details listed of connected midi devices (thats happening in                 listInputsAndOutputs() in the js code)
  You'll need to alter the js code to include the name of your device (js lines 38 and 49) - or invent some smoother
      method for yourself, if you would rather :)
  Fire it all up again, and you should see data arriving in the browser console when you 'do stuff' on the physical             device.
  ...Use the data for whatever crazy thing it is you want to! :)
